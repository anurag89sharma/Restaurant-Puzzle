 A Town provides prices of every item on every menu of every restaurant , all in a single CSV file. The restaurants also offer Value Meals, which are groups of several items, at a discounted price. The file's format is:
 
1. for lines that define a price for a single item:
            restaurant ID, price, item_label
2. for lines that define the price for a Value Meal (there can be any number of items in a value meal)
            restaurant ID, price, item_1_label, item_2_label, ...
 
 All restaurant IDs are integers, all item labels are underscore(no space) separated letters, and the price is a decimal number.
 
Write a program that accepts the town's price file, and a list of item labels that someone wants to eat for dinner, and outputs the restaurant they should go to, and the total price it will cost them.  It is okay to purchase extra items, as long as the total cost is minimized. If multiple restaurants are found, output any restaurant ID with the minimum price. DON'T OUTPUT ALL RESTAURANT IDs AND PRICEs. You can safely assume that SINGLE QUANTITY for any menu item will be asked by the user.

Also handle the following cases:
 
1. Menu directly available(1 item or all items).
2. Menu available but distributed over multiple items.
3. Menu need not be present in all restaurants listed.
4. Menu not available at all.
